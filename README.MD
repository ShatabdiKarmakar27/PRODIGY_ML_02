In implementing a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history,
the objective is to segment customers into distinct clusters, enabling the store to tailor marketing strategies effectively. Leveraging the K-means algorithm involves several steps. Initially, customer data is collected, typically including variables such as age,gender, total expenditure, and annual income. Subsequently, this data undergoes preprocessing to ensure uniformity and relevance. Following preprocessing, the K-means algorithm iteratively assigns customers to clusters based on the similarity of their purchase patterns. Each cluster is represented by a centroid, serving as the mean of the data points within that cluster. Through iterative optimization, the algorithm minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares, optimizing the clustering solution. Ultimately, the algorithm produces clusters that group together customers with similar purchasing behaviors, thereby empowering the retail store to tailor marketing campaigns, optimize inventory management, and enhance customer satisfaction.
